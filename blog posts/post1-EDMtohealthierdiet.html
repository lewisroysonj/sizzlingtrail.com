            <p>
                Healthy eating is not just about reducing obesity, however. Research work carried out at the Royal Marsden Hospital
            suggests that a third of all cancers are caused by poor diet. Diet can be linked to bowel cancer, stomach and lung
            cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis and tooth decay. Food nutrition and exercise are crucial to our
            health and well being. No doubt making the right choice of food and drink combined with taking regular exercise can
            protect against many western "killer diseases" like heart disease and cancer. There are also lots of immediate benefits
            and positive results in keeping slim for life.
            
            Eating a balanced nutritional diet can protect us from these illnesses. however, many myths still prevail. Contrary to
            popular opinion it is not about taking chips off the menu or sticking to salad, but simply eating more bulky, filling
            foods, piling on the fruit and vegetables, and eating less of the high-fat sugary foods. Some of the greatest dishes and
            most exciting cuisines in the world are based on these principles (e.g. paella, biryani, Chinese vegetables stir-fried
            with noodles, sushi and rice, couscous, and cannelloni stuffed with ricotta and spinach).
            </p>
            <h2>What it is about?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Filling up on bread, pasta, rice and potatoes</li>
                <img src="#" alt="bread">
                <p>Sticking to a salad is a great thing, but maintaining this for a long period is a hard thing to accomplish, but
                consuming things that you are used to consuming all your life is more than enough to live a good healthy life, taking
                into account on how you eat it! It's Important!
                
                Eat slightly more of these high fibre foods during your meal and less of those fatty foods, These foods easily get
                digested without causing much difference to your body, unlike the fatty foods which might cause you cholesterol, Weight
                gain etc.
                
                Try to eat wholemeal, wholegrain, brown or high fibre versions where possible..</p>
                <li>Eating more fruit and vegetables</li>
                <img src="#" alt="Fruits">
                <p>Every food has calories in it but not all calories are same, say for eg. A 100 calorie apple is way healthier than a 100
                calorie cheesecake! So try your best in eating more of these fruits and vegetables rather than those fatty/sugary stuff.
                
                Even more to that if you are looking for weight loss diet these fruits will help you so much in burning excess fat even
                while you are sleeping! that's because these fruits take more energy to get processed and digested in your stomach thus
                resulting in burning more calories.</p>
                <li>Eating a little less of some food items</li>
                <img src="#" alt="fancy junk food">
                <p>Well, eating more of the high fibre food is good, but when it comes to other food such as meat, fish, egg and other food
                or drinks high in fat(especially saturated fats) and sugar, it gets really important that you restrict yourself from
                consuming these more than roughly 30 % of your total food consumption throughout the day</p>
                <li>Enjoying good food</li>
                <img src="#" alt="good healthy food">
                <p>It gets really hard when it comes to enjoying eating healthy food such as vegetables or beans, but consuming these
                veggies in more creative and tasty ways will help in enjoying more eating these foods which help in improving your
                health vastly.</p>
                <li>Making small, gradual changes</li>
                <img src="#" alt="A diet plan">
                <p>Changing your diet suddenly is a very hard task to accomplish, but there is no need for hurrying except if you're
                getting ready for a shoot or fight! So take your time and change your diet one by one in the way you like it much, which
                going to help you stick in your diet for longer.</p>
                <li>Knowing more about food</li>
                <img src="#" alt="A kid looking at a plant of fruit">
                <p>If you are in a strict diet, there is nothing worse than not knowing what your food contains in it. So do some research,
                find out what it contains and restrict yourself from obvious bad ones. Get as much knowledge about your food as
                possible, It will help in deciding yourself what should you eat rather than depending on others.</p>
                <li>Altering food shopping patterns</li>
                <img src="#" alt="A women buying grocery">
                <p>Shopping is undoubtedly the most fun thing to for most of us, but it really gets hard to stop yourself from buying food
                from sections containing full of tempting processed unhealthy foods, but undoubtedly it is the worst thing you can do to
                yourself and your family. Get your hands to the right ones, choose more of the starchy high fibre food, fruits and
                vegetables and some of the dairy products and high protein products like egg, fish, beans and meat that you know will
                help you in making yourself better. The less of these processed foods you have in your house, the more you control
                yourself from eating those.</p>
                <li>Feeling satisfied and good about food</li>
                <img src="#" alt="A happy women in kithcen">
                <p>There is nothing better than the feeling you get after you eat a bunch of healthy food and there is nothing worse than
                the feeling you get after you eat something junk while you are in your healthy eating diet. So it is really helpful if
                you stay in your healthy diet for being happy both physically and emotionally.</p>
