        <p style="width: 40rem;">
          <span>Healthy</span> eating is not just about reducing obesity, however. Research work carried out at the
          Royal Marsden Hospital
          suggests that a third of all cancers are caused by poor diet. Diet can be linked to bowel cancer, stomach and
          lung
          cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis and tooth decay. Food nutrition and exercise are crucial
          to our
          health and well being. No doubt making the right choice of food and drink combined with taking regular
          exercise can
          protect against many western "killer diseases" like heart disease and cancer. There are also lots of immediate
          benefits
          and positive results in keeping slim for life.</p>

        </br>
        <p>Eating a balanced nutritional diet can protect us from these illnesses. however, many myths still prevail.
          Contrary to
          popular opinion it is not about taking chips off the menu or sticking to salad, but simply eating more bulky,
          filling
          foods, piling on the fruit and vegetables, and eating less of the high-fat sugary foods. Some of the greatest
          dishes and
          most exciting cuisines in the world are based on these principles (e.g. paella, biryani, Chinese vegetables
          stir-fried
          with noodles, sushi and rice, couscous, and cannelloni stuffed with ricotta and spinach).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color: black;">What it is about?</h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Filling up on bread, pasta, rice and potatoes</li>
          <br><img class="post1img2" src="/imgs/bread with seeds.webp" alt="bread">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sticking to a salad is a great thing, but maintaining this for a long
            period is a hard thing to accomplish, but
            consuming things that you are used to consuming all your life is more than enough to live a good healthy
            life, taking
            into account on how you eat it! It's Important!

            Eat slightly more of these high fibre foods during your meal and less of those fatty foods, These foods
            easily get
            digested without causing much difference to your body, unlike the fatty foods which might cause you
            cholesterol, Weight
            gain etc.

            Try to eat wholemeal, wholegrain, brown or high fibre versions where possible.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Eating more fruit and vegetables</li>
          <br><img class="post1img3" src="/imgs/grapes.webp" alt="Grapes">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every food has calories in it but not all calories are same, say for
            eg. A 100 calorie apple is way healthier than a 100
            calorie cheesecake! So try your best in eating more of these fruits and vegetables rather than those
            fatty/sugary stuff.

            Even more to that if you are looking for weight loss diet these fruits will help you so much in burning
            excess fat even
            while you are sleeping! that's because these fruits take more energy to get processed and digested in your
            stomach thus
            resulting in burning more calories.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Eating a little less of some food items</li>
          <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/breakfastegg.webp" alt="women eating waffle">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, eating more of the high fibre food is good, but when it comes to
            other food such as meat, fish, egg and other food
            or drinks high in fat(especially saturated fats) and sugar, it gets really important that you restrict
            yourself from
            consuming these more than roughly 30 % of your total food consumption throughout the day.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Enjoying good food</li>
          <br><img class="post1img5" src="/imgs/women cooking in kitchen.webp" alt="Women cooking">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gets really hard when it comes to enjoying eating healthy food such
            as vegetables or beans, but consuming these
            veggies in more creative and tasty ways will help in enjoying more eating these foods which help in
            improving your
            health vastly.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Making small, gradual changes</li>
          <br><img class="post1img6" src="/imgs/mealplanplate.webp" alt="A diet plan">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing your diet suddenly is a very hard task to accomplish, but
            there is no need for hurrying except if you're
            getting ready for a shoot or fight! So take your time and change your diet one by one in the way you like it
            much, which
            going to help you stick in your diet for longer.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Knowing more about food</li>
          <br><img class="post1img7" src="/imgs/mom and daughter eating cake.webp" alt="kid eating cake with mom">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in a strict diet, there is nothing worse than not knowing
            what your food contains in it. So do some research,
            find out what it contains and restrict yourself from obvious bad ones. Get as much knowledge about your food
            as
            possible, It will help in deciding yourself what should you eat rather than depending on others.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Altering food shopping patterns</li>
          <br><img class="post1img8" src="/imgs/women buying fruits.webp" alt="A women buying fruits">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopping is undoubtedly the most fun thing to for most of us, but it
            really gets hard to stop yourself from buying food
            from sections containing full of tempting processed unhealthy foods, but undoubtedly it is the worst thing
            you can do to
            yourself and your family. Get your hands to the right ones, choose more of the starchy high fibre food,
            fruits and
            vegetables and some of the dairy products and high protein products like egg, fish, beans and meat that you
            know will
            help you in making yourself better. The less of these processed foods you have in your house, the more you
            control
            yourself from eating those.</p>
          <br>
          <li>Feeling satisfied and good about food</li>
          <br><img class="post1img9" src="/imgs/happy couple feeding eachother.webp" alt="couple feeding each other">
          <br>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing better than the feeling you get after you eat a bunch
            of healthy food and there is nothing worse than
            the feeling you get after you eat something junk while you are in your healthy eating diet. So it is really
            helpful if
            you stay in your healthy diet for being happy both physically and emotionally.</p>
