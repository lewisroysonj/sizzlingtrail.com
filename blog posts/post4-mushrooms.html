                <p><span>Mushrooms</span>, the fruiting bodies of fungi that grow above the ground, have been a part
                    of the human diet and used as both
                    food and medicine for centuries; they are considered as one of the most ancient foods of all
                    time, ancient Greeks
                    believed that mushrooms provided strength for warriors in battle, and the Romans perceived them
                    as the “Food of the
                    Gods”.
                    <br>Mushroom is one of the best diets, which contains protein, minerals and vitamins like
                    Nutritive material in a sufficient
                    quantity. Mushroom is having less quantity of fats due to this reason it is a very good diet for
                    heart patients and due
                    to the very fewer carbohydrates mushroom is the most suitable diet for diabetic patients.

                    <br> Mushrooms are popular because of the valuable important nutrients, including selenium,
                    potassium, riboflavin, niacin,
                    vitamin D, proteins, and fiber in them; also they are cholesterol-free and low in calories,
                    carbohydrates, fat and
                    sodium.

                    <br> Mushrooms are also important for their healing capacities and properties in traditional
                    medicine and act as
                    antibacterial, immune system enhancer and cholesterol-lowering agents. It has beneficial effects
                    on the health and
                    treatment of some diseases. They are also known to lower the risks of cancer.</p>

                <h2>Role in Modern Culinary:</h2>
                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/mushroom dish (1).jpg" alt="Mushroom dish">
                <br>
                <p>Mushrooms are fungi, biologically distinct from the plant and animal-derived foods, they have
                    been considered as
                    ingredient of gourmet cuisine across the globe, they are considered as a delicacy with high
                    nutritional and functional
                    value, and they are also accepted as nutraceutical foods.

                    <br>Mushrooms are classified into food grouping systems by their use as a vegetable, mushroom's
                    increasing use in main
                    dishes in plant-based diets is growing, helping consumers to follow dietary guidance
                    recommendations and especially
                    because of their unique flavour they have been valued by humankind as a culinary wonder.

                    <br> Mushrooms have many flavors and nutrient characteristics that make them an ideal addition
                    to many dishes. Their texture
                    and savory flavour properties make them a suitable substitute for meat. Mushrooms contribute
                    moisture that improves the
                    mouthfeel and overall sensory appeal of many dishes, they contain about 92% water in them which
                    makes them low-calorie
                    dense and can reduce the energy density of the final dish.

                    Mushrooms can be used as a substitute for ground beef in dishes such as ground beef-based burger
                    patties because of
                    their meaty flavour and texture although they lack in protein, a blend of ground meat and
                    mushroom can result in a
                    low-calorie dish with that same deliciousness of the meat.

                    <br> There are more than 2,000 species of mushrooms exist in nature, but around 25 are widely
                    accepted as food and few are commercially cultivated.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Five of the most cultivated mushrooms worldwide :</h2>

                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Agaricus bisporus</li>
                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/button mushroom.jpg" alt="Agaricus bisporus">
                    <br>
                    <p>These are also known as the white button mushroom,crimini, and portabella; these are the most
                        commonly consumed mushroom in the world and are native to grasslands in
                        Europe and North America. It has two colour states while immature – white and brown.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li>Lentinus edodes (Shiitake Mushrooms)</li>
                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/shiitake mushroom (1).jpg" alt="Shiitake mushrooms">
                    <br>
                    <p>It is an edible mushroom native to East Asia, which is cultivated and consumed in many Asian
                        countries. It is considered
                        a medicinal mushroom in some forms of traditional medicine. Shiitake grow in groups on the
                        decaying wood of deciduous
                        trees.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li>Pleurotus ostreatus (Oyster)</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>It is another common edible mushroom. It was first cultivated in Germany during World War I
                        and is now grown
                        commercially around the world for food. It is related to the similarly cultivated king
                        oyster mushroom. The oyster
                        mushroom is one of the more commonly sought wild mushrooms.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li>Volvariella volvacea (Straw)</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>It is a species of edible mushroom cultivated throughout East and Southeast Asia and used
                        extensively in Asian cuisines.
                        They are often available fresh in Asia but are more frequently found in canned or dried
                        forms outside their nations of
                        cultivation.
                        <br>Worldwide, straw mushrooms rank third in consumption, although their use in the West is
                        somewhat uncommon and usually
                        confined to use in Oriental cooking.</p>

                    <br>
                    <li>Flammulina ostreatus (Enoki)</li>
                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/enoki (1).jpg" alt="enoki mushroom">
                    <br>
                    <p>It is well-known for its role in Japanese cuisine, where it is also known as Enokitake.
                        Commercially farmed enoki is a
                        long, thin white mushroom and is a popular ingredient for soups, especially in East Asian
                        cuisine, but can be used for
                        salads and other dishes. The mushroom has a crisp texture and can be refrigerated for
                        approximately one week.</p>
                </ol>

                <br>
                <p>Mushroom production is continuously increasing, China being the biggest producer around the
                    world. However, wild
                    mushrooms are becoming more important for their nutritional, sensory, and especially
                    pharmacological characteristics,
                    which encourage more people to hunt for these wild mushrooms but hunting wild mushrooms is a
                    tricky task as there are so
                    many poisonous mushrooms which share a similar look with their safer counterparts.</p>
