                <p><span>Hunting</span> for those delicious wild mushrooms can be a fun and interesting thing to do when
                    you are out on the woods but it
                    becomes challenging and tricky to decide whether the mushroom you found is safe to eat or not,
                    that's why here are some
                    procedures to follow to help ensure a positive experience all the way from the forest to fork.</p>

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collect carefully, Carry a digging tool and a roll of wax paper (not plastic wrap, which speeds
                        up decay) in a
                        flat-bottomed basket. This kit will allow you to collect entire specimens, keep them separate,
                        and avoid crushing them.</li>
                    <li>field details for mushrooms that need to be identified for eg, where the mushroom is growing (on
                        wood, soil, or
                        decaying organic material), habit (single or in clusters), the colour of the various parts of
                        the mushroom, and
                        distinctive features such as staining or bruising.</li>
                    <li>Take only fresh, young specimens, and wrap them so that different species are kept separate.
                        </il>
                    <li>Double-check the identification, to be completely confident that a mushroom is edible, make sure
                        that all the features
                        of the mushroom in hand match those described in this guide. If all but a few features match,
                        the mushroom may be a
                        similar-looking yet poisonous mushroom.</li>
                    <li>Be sure to inspect every mushroom. It is easy when gathering mushrooms to harvest a
                        similar-looking yet different and
                        potentially dangerous mushroom. Give each mushroom a thorough inspection. Try a small amount
                        first. Even popular
                        mushrooms like morels can make some people sick.</li>
                    <li>Never eat a raw mushroom. To rid mushrooms of insects, slice them lengthwise and soak them in
                        salted water for a few
                        minutes. Cooking will kill any harmful bacteria that might be present.</li>
                    <li>Don’t eat old mushrooms. Many edible mushrooms are good to eat for a very short period.</li>
                    <li>Discard any soggy, foul-smelling or darkening mushroom.</li>
                    <li>When in doubt, throw it out. If you are in the slightest doubt of the identification of a
                        mushroom, don’t risk eating
                        it.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h3>Below are the lists of some of the Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms:</h3>


                <br>
                <h2>EDIBLE MUSHROOMS</h2>

                <br><img src="/imgs/mushrooms in a basket1 (1).jpg" alt="Mushrooms in a basket" class="post1img4">

                <br>
                <h2>The Puffballs:</h2>


                <br><img src="/imgs/puffball1.webp" alt="Gem-studded puffball Lycoperdon perlatum" class="post1img2">
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Puffballs are white, rounded to turban-shaped balls, with or without spiny warts, and a pore at
                        the top.</li>

                    <li>They become yellowish to pinkish to brownish with age and change from pure white on the inside
                        to brownish dust. When
                        mature, a pore opens at the top to release thick, dusty-brown spores.</li>

                    <li>Puffballs appear in late summer or fall (July–October) and grow in lawns, open woods, pastures,
                        and barren areas on soil
                        or decaying wood.</li>

                    <li>Commonly, they are found roughly 1–2½ inches wide and 1–3 inches tall, say for the size from a
                        golf ball to a soccer
                        ball although some can be as much as 20 inches wide and tall</li>

                    <li>They are found growing singly or in clusters.</li>


                    <br>
                    <h4>Caution: If a sliced specimen shows any sign of a developing cap or stem inside, it means the
                        mushroom is not a puffball
                        and should not be eaten.</h4>
                    <br>
                    <h4>
                        Cooking hints: Remove outer skin if it is tough, slice, dip in batter and fry.</h4>

                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/puffball2 (1).jpg"
                        alt="Pear-shaped puffball Lycoperdon pyriforme">


                    <br>
                    <h2>Shaggy Mane:</h2>

                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/shaggymane.webp" alt="Shaggy Mane mushroom">

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A white mushroom when young, with a shaggy, cylindrical cap that turns black and inky with
                            age. As the mushroom matures,
                            the cap gradually expands from a cylindrical shape to a bell shape, with the cap’s white
                            scales turning brownish and
                            becoming more upturned, giving the cap a shaggier texture. Finally, the cap and gills become
                            inky black and liquefy,
                            leaving only the standing stalk.</li>

                        <li>The spore print from a shaggy mane is black.</li>

                        <li>Shaggy mane is usually found growing 4–6 inches tall. It is distinctive enough that, with a
                            little practice, you can
                            easily distinguish it from other white, potentially poisonous mushrooms that grow in open
                            areas.</li>

                        <li>While this mushroom is most commonly found in the fall (September–October) and growing in
                            large numbers along roadsides
                            and in lawns, it can also be seen in the spring and growing in other interesting places like
                            wood-chip piles and hard,
                            disturbed ground.</li>

                        <li>Often seen in large numbers of scattered individuals.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: Until you become familiar with shaggy mane, be sure to look for the developing ink or
                        make a spore print to
                        confirm that it has black spores. Beware — many white mushrooms that are not shaggy mane also
                        grow in the same habitat.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cooking hints: Pick only young, fresh specimens. If you want to store them, cook them as soon as
                        you can after
                        harvesting, then refrigerate. Once picked, they will begin to dissolve into inky liquid in just
                        a few hours.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h2>Coral Fungi:</h2>

                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/coral fungi.webp" alt="Coral mushroom Ramaria sp.">


                    <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>These fungi appear as clumps of branching stems that point upward, giving a coral-like
                            structure. Most are tan, whitish,
                            or yellowish, and a few are pinkish or purple.</li>

                        <li>Coral mushrooms grow in wooded areas on the ground or decaying logs.</li>

                        <li>They can be found in spring and summer (June–September). </li>

                        <li>Coral fungi typically grow as single or scattered individuals.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: While no serious poisonings from coral fungi have been reported, some similar-looking
                        mushrooms also referred
                        to as coral fungi are known to cause gastrointestinal upset, and some people may be particularly
                        sensitive. Avoid coral
                        fungi that taste bitter, bruise brown when handled, or have gelatinous bases. A look-alike
                        mushroom is the jellied false
                        coral, which has tough branches, unlike the brittle branches of true coral mushrooms, which
                        break easily.</h4>

                        alt="Crown-tipped coral Artomyces pyxidatus">


                    <br>
                    <h4>Cooking hints: The mushroom tips and upper branches are most tender. Sauté and add to vegetables
                        or white sauce.</h4>

                    <br>
                    <h2>Morels:</h2>

                    <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/commen morels.webp" alt="Common morel Morchella americana">

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Morels have a honeycombed cap with black to brownish-black ridges and yellowish-brown pits.
                        </li>

                        <li>The stem is sometimes enlarged at the base and is completely hollow. The caps on morels are
                            elongate and conical with
                            vertically elongated ridges and pits. Spores are white to cream-coloured and located inside
                            the pits.</li>

                        <li>The size of morel mushrooms can vary, ranging from 2–12 inches tall.</li>

                        <li>Morels are found on the ground in a variety of habitats, particularly in moist woodlands and
                            in river bottoms. They are
                            often associated with ash trees, dying elms, and apple trees, although they are found
                            elsewhere under both hardwoods and
                            conifers.</li>

                        <li>Morels typically appear from March to early May.</li>

                        <li>There are three common species of morels</li>

                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li style="color: black;">The common morel (Morchella Americana):</li>
                            <h4>When young, this species
                                has white ridges and
                                grey to brown pits and is known
                                as the “white morel” or “grey morel.” As it ages, both the ridges and the pits turn
                                yellow-brown. At this stage, it is
                                often referred to as a “yellow morel.” If conditions are right, the yellow morel can
                                become a giant morel, which may
                                grow up to a foot tall.</h4>

                            <li style="color: black;">The black morel or smoky morel (Morchella angusticeps):</li>
                            <h4>The ridges
                                are grey or tan when
                                young but darken with age
                                until nearly black. The pits are brown and elongated. These morels are best when picked
                                young. Discard any that are
                                shrunken or have completely blackheads.</h4>

                            <li style="color: black;">The half-free morel (Morchella punctipes):</li>
                            <h4> This is the only morel
                                that does not have the
                                bottom of the cap fused to
                                the stem. The cap of the half-free morel is attached at about the middle. These morels
                                have small caps and long, bulbous
                                stems. They also may be confused with the wrinkled thimble-cap (Verpa bohemica), which
                                has a cap that is free from the
                                stem except at the top. Fortunately, the wrinkled thimble-cap is edible in moderation.
                                Found as scattered individuals.</h4>
                        </ol>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: Like all wild edible mushrooms, morels must be thoroughly cooked and not eaten raw.
                        Beware of the poisonous
                        false morels</h4>

                        </li>

                        <li>The bearded tooth is white when young but yellows with age.</li>

                        <li>A stalk is not present; spines hang evenly from a central base.</li>

                        <li>The spore print is white.</li>

                        <li>A bearded tooth mushroom may grow quite large, as much as a foot across. Each spine is ½–2

                        <li>The bearded tooth is found growing on trunks of living hardwood trees and fallen trees and
                            logs during late summer and
                            fall (August–November).</li>

                        mushroom, comb tooth (Hericium coralloides) is a closely related species that is more open, with
                        branched spines.
                        Fortunately, the comb tooth is also a good edible when young and white.</h4>

                        <li>A gilled whitish, greyish, or tan cap with a stubby, off-centre stalk. The cap is
                            shell-shaped, semicircular to
                            elongated like an oyster and has a smooth, sometimes wavy margin.</li>

                        <li>The gills are narrow, and their attachment descends along a short, thick stalk.</li>

                        <li>Spores are white to greyish-lilac.</li>

                        <li>Two species are referred to as an oyster mushroom, and both are edible. Both species look
                            alike.</li>

                        <li>The cap is 1–8 inches wide with a stalk up to 1¼ inches long and ¾ inch wide.</li>

                        <li>Oyster mushrooms grow year-round and always on wood. They sometimes appear to be growing out
                            of the ground, but they are
                            attached to tree roots beneath the soil surface.</li>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: Because several similar-looking species grow on wood, confirm the identification of
                        oyster mushrooms by making
                        a spore print. Most species that get misidentified as oyster mushrooms are not dangerous, but
                        they may be woody or
                        unpleasant tasting. Watch out for the small black beetles that sometimes infest this mushroom.

                        <li>Instead of having gills or ridges on the underside of the thick, spongy cap, they have a
                            tightly packed network of
                            downward-facing tubes that form the pore surface.</li>

                        <li>There are over 200 species of boletes in North America.</li>

                        <li>The caps are usually brownish or reddish-brown, while the pores may be white, yellow,
                            orange, red, olive, or brown.</li>

                        <li>Boletes can grow up to 10 inches tall with caps 1–10 inches wide.</li>

                        <li>These mushrooms are found growing on the ground near or under trees during summer and fall
                            (May–November).</li>

                        <li>Individuals are found growing scattered, not in compacted groups.</li>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: Boletes are considered a good, safe, edible group for beginning mushroom collectors.
                        However, you should
                        observe these cautions:</h4>

                    <br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>A few boletes are poisonous. To avoid these, don’t eat any boletes that have orange or red
                            pores or that bruise blue.
                            “Bruising blue is not for you. Some boletes, while not poisonous, are very distasteful.
                            Confirm the identification using
                            several field characteristics and sample a small amount of the cooked mushroom. If it’s
                            bitter or otherwise unpleasant,
                            throw it out.</li>

                        <li>Before cooking the mushroom, check to see if the cap is slimy. Sometimes an outer layer of
                            slime develops as the
                            mushroom ages or once it is harvested. This layer can cause diarrhoea and will need to be
                            removed before cooking.</li>

                        <li>Boletes decay quickly. Be sure to eat boletes the same day you collect them.</li>

                        <li>Check for bugs, often found within the cap of the mushroom.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cooking hints: Remove tough stems, and peel off the pore layer in all but the youngest
                        specimens. Sauté in butter and
                        add to any cheese dish. Dried boletes are also good in soups</h4>

                    <ul>

                        <li>The bright-orange caps of these mushrooms make them the easiest edible to spot. The caps do

                            flat and shelflike, with a fleshy texture.</li>

                        <li>Young mushrooms have vibrant colour but fade to a peach or salmon colour with age.</li>

                        <li>The spore print is white. Size: Chicken of the woods can range in size from 2–12 inches
                            wide.</li>

                        <li>This mushroom is found on dead or dying hardwood trees, stumps, buried roots, or living
                            trees.</li>

                        <li>It can be found in summer and fall (May–November) and rarely found in the spring, depending

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cautions: The distinctive colour and growth pattern of chicken of the woods makes it difficult
                        to mistake it for any
                        other mushroom. However, it does cause a mild allergic reaction (swollen lips) in some people.
                        If you’re eating it for
                        the first time, cook and try a small amount to determine if it will cause an allergic reaction.
                    </h4>

                    <br>
                    <h4>Cooking hints: Cook only the tender outer edges of the caps because the inner portions are tough
                        and woody. Be sure to
                        gather only the young, fresh mushrooms with vibrant colour. As the mushroom ages and the colour
                        fades, it will turn
                        tough and woody. Slice and simmer in the stock for 45 minutes, then serve creamed on toast. When
                        cooked, this mushroom
                        has the texture and often the taste of chicken and can be used as a chicken substitute in

                <br>
                <p>Every mushroom hunter should be familiar with the three most dangerous groups of fungi. These are the
                    amanitas, the
                    false morels, and a catch-all category known as little brown mushrooms (LBMs). Mushrooms in these
                    groups cause virtually
                    all the fatal mushroom poisonings in the United States, with amanitas alone accounting for 90 per
                    cent of
                    mushroom-related deaths. Avoid eating any mushroom resembling these three categories.

                    <br>
                    There are hundreds of other mushrooms will cause anything from a mild stomachache to severe physical
                    distress, including
                    vomiting, diarrhoea, cramps, and loss of coordination. Two common poisonous mushrooms of this type,
                    the Jacko’-lantern
                    and the green-spored lepiota, are described here. Although the symptoms of poisoning from these
                    mushrooms may be
                    alarming, they usually pass in 24 hours or less with no lasting effects. You should, however, notify
                    your doctor
                    immediately if you suspect mushroom poisoning of any kind.</p>

                <h2>Amanitas:</h2>

                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/amanitas.webp" alt="The fly agaric Amanita muscaria">


                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a large group of mushrooms that can be difficult to tell apart.</li>

                    <li>Memorable names include destroying angel, fly agaric, yellow patches, blusher, grisette,
                        ringless panther, death cap,
                        and fool’s mushroom.</li>

                    <li>Several members of this group contain amanitin, one of the deadliest poisons found in nature.
                        One cap of a destroying angel can kill a person.</li>

                    <li>Each amanita starts as an egg-shaped “button” that can resemble a small puffball mushroom.</li>

                    <li>The button breaks open as the mushroom grows. Fully developed amanitas are gilled mushrooms with
                        parasol-shaped caps
                        that may be white, yellow, red, or brown.</li>

                    <li>They also have the following characteristics:</li>

                    <li>A saclike cup surrounding the base of the stem. This is called a volva. It is often buried just
                        beneath the soil
                        surface, and it may not be obvious.</li>

                    <li>A ring on the stem. Amanitas are known to have this feature, but it is not always present. Some
                        amanita species lack a
                        ring on the stem, or it is no longer present as the ring may not persist.</li>

                    <li>White gills and white spore print. Both the ring and the vulva may be obscure or destroyed by
                        rain or other disturbance.
                        For this reason, beginning mushroom hunters should avoid all parasol shaped mushrooms with white
                        gills and white spore
                        print.</li>

                    <li>The sizes of amanita mushrooms vary greatly, depending on species and growing conditions.</li>

                    <li>Amanitas are usually found on the ground in woodlands and open places in summer and fall.</li>

                    <li>These mushrooms grow as scattered individuals.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h2>False Morels:</h2>

                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/flase morels.webp" alt="False Morels Mushrooms">

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>False morels have also been called red morels, elephant ears, Arkansas morels, and elfin
                        saddles.</li>

                    <li>They should be considered poisonous, although many people have enjoyed eating them and some even
                        consider them a
                        favourite edible wild mushroom.</li>

                    <li>However, false morels have caused serious illnesses and deaths.</li>

                    <li>They contain various levels of gyromitrin, a toxin that when consumed, is hydrolyzed into the
                        toxic compound
                        monomethylhydrazine. This compound causes diarrhoea, vomiting, severe headaches, and can
                        occasionally be fatal. Because
                        of different cooking techniques and different individual sensitivities, false morels sicken some
                        people but leave others
                        seemingly unaffected.</li>

                    <li>However, the toxin is known to accumulate in the body over time, perhaps delaying effects of the
                        toxin.</li>

                    <li>A short glance, false morels look can look like true morels (Morchella) but there are rather
                        obvious differences between
                        them.</li>

                    <li>The cap surface of false morels has lobes, folds, flaps, or wrinkles, but not pits and ridges
                        like true morels.</li>

                    <li>Their caps appear to bulge outward instead of being pitted inward like true morels.</li>

                    <li>False morels also do not have a hollow centre like that found inside a true morel.</li>

                    <li>False morels typically range in size from 2–8 inches.</li>

                    <li>These mushrooms are found in spring, summer, and fall in woodlands. They are most commonly
                        spotted in the spring when
                        more people are in the woods looking for true morels.</li>

                    <li>False morels are found as scattered individuals on the ground.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Little Brown Mushrooms (LBMs):</h2>

                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/little brown mushrooms.webp" alt="Little brown mushrooms">

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Like the LGBs (little grey birds) in bird-watching parlance, LBMs is a catchall category.</ <li>
                        It includes all small- to medium-sized, hard-to-identify brownish mushrooms with spores of all
                        colours.</li>

                    <li>They are found in all seasons and all habitats.</li>

                    <li>Many LBMs are harmless, while some are mild to severely poisonous.</li>

                    <li>The innocent-looking little mushrooms of the genus Galerina are probably the most dangerous of
                        the LBMs.</li>

                    <li>They contain the same toxin as amanitas but luckily have caused very few deaths.</li>

                    <li>Galerina mushrooms grow in clusters on wood and have a brownish spore print.</li>

                    <li>Because they are difficult to identify, all LBM’s should be avoided.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h2>Jack-o’-Lantern:</h2>

                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/jacko lantern.webp" alt="Jack-o'Lantern Mushroom">

                <br>
                <ul>

                    <li>Bright orange to yellowish-orange mushroom, the Jacko’-lantern is well named for its pumpkin
                        colour, appearance in the
                        fall, and occasional illumination of a faint greenish glow that can be visible at night or in a
                        darkened room.</li>

                    <li>It has sharp-edged gills descending the stalk, and the cap is convex, becoming flat to
                        funnel-shaped and sunken in the
                        centre.</li>

                    <li>The colour and funnel shape of the cap has caused some to mistake it for the edible chanterelle
                        mushroom. An easy way to
                        distinguish a jack o’-lantern from a chanterelle is to cut the mushroom length-wise down the
                        middle.</li>

                    <li>The inner tissue of jack-o’-lantern is orange while the inner tissue of chanterelles is white.
                        The gills of
                        Jacko’-lanterns are also narrow and sharp, unlike the folds and ridges on the pore surface of
                        chanterelles.</li>

                    <li>Jack-o’-lantern mushrooms have caused many poisonings because of their attractive appearance and
                        abundance. Although
                        eating them has not been known to be life-threatening to healthy adults, they can cause mild to
                        a severe upset stomach.</li>

                    <li>Jack-o’-lanterns are typically found 2–8 inches tall, with caps ranging from 2–8 inches wide.
                    </li>

                    <li>These mushrooms are found in summer and fall (July–October) at the base of trees, on stumps, or
                        buried wood.</li>

                    <li>Considering growth habit is another way to decipher between jack-o’-lantern and chanterelle
                        mushrooms. Jack-o’-lanterns
                        grow on wood in large clusters that are so tightly packed they sometimes appear to be growing on
                        top of each other.</li>

                    <li>Chanterelle mushrooms grow as scattered individuals on the ground.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h2>Green-Spored Lepiota:</h2>

                <br><img class="post1img4" src="/imgs/green spored lapiota.webp" alt="Green-Spored Lepiota">

                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>These large, common mushrooms often appear in fairy rings on suburban lawns and cattle pastures.
                        Perhaps because they
                        look similar to the white mushrooms sold in grocery stores, they are one of the most commonly
                        eaten poisonous mushrooms.</li>

                    <li>Green-spored lepiotas cause violent gastrointestinal upset, including vomiting and diarrhoea
                        severe enough to require
                        hospitalization.</li>

                    <li>The green-spored lepiota is parasol-shaped with a cream or tan scaly cap, and a large ring on
                        the stalk.</li>

                    <li>The gills are white to cream-coloured and turn dingy green with age. The thick, white stalk
                        enlarges toward the base and
                        darkens when handled.</li>

                    <li>The spore print is green.</li>

                    <li>Green-spored lepiotas can become quite large, measuring up to 12 inches tall with caps up to 12
                        inches in diameter.</li>

                    <li>This mushroom is found in summer and fall (July– September) and can easily be spotted on lawns
                        and pastures.</li>

                    <li>They can grow as single individuals or often appear in a fairy ring.</li>
