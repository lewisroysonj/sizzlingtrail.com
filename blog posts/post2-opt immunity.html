                    <span>The Immune system</span> protects the body against infections, viruses and other external and
                    internal insults by utilizing
                    three distinct layers i.e, physical and chemical barriers, nonspecific resistance, and specific
                    resistance depending on
                    the nature of the threat.
                    Immunity in a human body depends vastly on the age of the particular, a newly born baby tends to
                    have low immunity which
                    gets better as he ages and gets optimal in adolescents and adults and starts to gradually decline as
                    he ages.

                    other environmental
                    factors such as ageing, stress etc. Adequate nutrition is crucial to ensure a good supply of the
                    energy sources,
                    macronutrients and micronutrients required for the development and maintenance of the immune
                    response. Micronutrients
                    have vital roles throughout the immune system that are independent of the age of a particular person
                    and it has been
                    determined that those most needed for a healthy immune system include:

                        they’ll pack a similar
                        nutritional value as their fresh counterparts.</li>
